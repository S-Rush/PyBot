Admin modules are only activated when a user both in the admin list and verified by NickServ
sends a message with '.admin' at the beginning. Within this, any admin commands can be
implemented similarly to the implementation of the normal modules. Here is a list of the
method signatures that will be called in admin modules:

Parameters:
f		: the socket file
sender	: the nick of the message sender
msg		: the content of the message
loc		: the location of the message (either a channel, for channel messages, or username for private)
rsvp	: the function for simple responses, used rsvp(f,loc,msg)
send	: the raw send function
auths	: the list of auth tiers for each user

handle(f,sender,msg,loc,rsvp,send,authtiers)
	Called on channel messages.
privhandle(f,sender,msg,loc,rsvp,send,authtiers)
	Called on private messages. Note sender == loc.
