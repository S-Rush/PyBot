Modules are activated from any message. Any behavior can be implemented
within a module contingent on the module methods. Here is a list of the
method signatures that will be called in modules:

Parameters:
f		: the socket file
sender	: the nick of the message sender
msg		: the content of the message
loc		: the location of the message (either a channel, for channel messages, or username for private)
rsvp	: the function for simple responses, used rsvp(f,loc,msg)
send	: the raw send function

handle(f,sender,msg,loc,rsvp,send)
	Called on channel messages.
privhandle(f,sender,msg,loc,rsvp,send)
	Called on private messages. Note sender == loc.
